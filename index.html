            <h1>Elegant Henna Art for Every Occasion</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Ashlesha Parekh. You can call me "Ash" :).
                I am a henna artist based in New Jersey. So glad you found me!
                <br>
                <br>

                My passion for creativity and love of art has compelled me to explore many areas of the arts. In 2007,
                I acquired my Bachelor of Arts in Visual Communications from Stockton University.
                <br>
                <br>

                When I was growing up in India, henna/mehendi was a huge part of my life.
                My passion for this ancient art form kicked off when I started doing mehendi for friends & family and
                hosting henna booths at festivals as a stay-at-home mom.

                I am now a full-time professional mehndi artist of 11 years, serving the entire New
                Jersey-Pennsylvania-Delaware tri-state area.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p> specialize in Indian bridal henna, but I also do henna for a variety of events, including but not
                limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sweet 16s</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Birthday Parties</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Girls Nights</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Fundraisers</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Sangeet Mehendi</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Bat Mitzvah</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Belly Blessing</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Fairs</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Festivals</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Private Appointments</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>I also apply the intricate henna designs on wood-burning mandala art.
                It’s another creative outlet when I am not doing mehendi.</p>
            <p>Together, let's explore the art of henna and let it compliment the beauty of our skin! </p>

            <p>"Henna By Ash is amazing! Her talent and attention to detail are truly incredible.
                The designs were intricate and beautifully done! The henna itself was high quality, resulting in a rich,
                long-lasting stain.
                They were also so kind and professional, making the entire experience even more enjoyable. I highly
                recommend!" -Pure Toms River Yoga
                <br>
                <br>
                "Ash was absolutely lovely. This was for a bridal mehendi party. Ash made everyone feel so welcome &
                comfortable and checked in during the application.
                She worked so hard and did a lovely job on everyones mehendi & henna. I loved the glitter application as
                well- something very special & unique." -Sarah Ellis
                <br>
                <br>
                "I cannot thank Ash enough for her work at our Mehndi. Aside from her designs and artwork being so
                beautiful,
                she is just such a great person to be around and made the experience so enjoyable. Because of the
                weather changing up our wedding plans,
                I (the bride) was an emotional wreck while getting my mehndi done and she was so supportive and kind.
                Everyone loved their mehndi and was raving about her work.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thank you so much, Ash!" -Christie Porter
