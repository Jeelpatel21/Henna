            <h2>What is henna?</h2><br>

            Henna is a natural dye made from the leaves of the Lawsonia inermis plant. When crushed into a fine powder
            and mixed with liquid (like lemon juice or water), it creates a paste that stains the skin, hair, and nails
            in a reddish-brown color.
            Henna is commonly used for body art, hair dye, and cooling/medicinal purposes. <br>
            ​Jagua henna is a term often used to describe jagua-based temporary tattoos, which are sometimes marketed as
            an alternative to henna. However, jagua and henna come from completely different plants:
            Jagua comes from the Genipa americana fruit, a tropical tree native to South America. The gel extracted from
            the fruit stains the skin a deep blue-black color.
            Henna comes from the Lawsonia inermis plant and stains the skin in shades of reddish-brown.​​<br>

            <h2> Henna safe for everyone?</h2><br>
            Henna is generally safe for most people when it's natural and free from additives, but people with G6PD
            deficiency,
            sensitive skin, and allergies & infants and young children should be cautious. <br><br>

            <h2> Henna safe during pregnancy?</h2><br>
            Yes, the natural henna I use is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy.
            As a matter of fact, many pregnant individuals enjoy henna belly art as a cultural or celebratory tradition.
            However, consult your doctor or midwife before using henna if you're still unsure.<br>

            <h2> is black henna?</h2><br>
            Black henna is a type of henna that contains added chemicals, most commonly paraphenylenediamine (PPD),
            to create a darker, almost black stain on the skin. Unlike natural henna,
            which stains the skin in shades of orange to deep reddish-brown,
            black henna can appear very dark but comes with the risks of severe allergic reactions, chemical burns &
            scarring,
            and increased sensitivity to hair dyes and other chemicals. <br>

            <h2>How to prepare for a henna appointment?</h2><br>
            Preparing for a henna appointment ensures the best stain results and a smooth experience. Here are some tips
            to help you prepare:<br>

            Exfoliate & Clean Your Skin
            Wear Loose, Comfortable Clothing
            Stay Hydrated & Eat Beforehand
            Plan for Drying Time
            Bring Essential

            <h2> ingredients are in the henna you use?</h2> <br>
            ​
            The natural henna I use contains the henna powder, lavender essential oil, sugar, & lemon juice or water.
